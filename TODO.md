Basic:

- Macros.
- Maps.
- Sets.
- Vars.
- Namespaces.
- Meta.
- Basic interop.
- Procotols.
- Numbers (flaot, bignums, rats).
- Core.

Optimizations:

- Unboxing (interface{} -> int, string, ...).
- Calls to host functions without reflect.
- Host variables instead of symbol table.

For later:

- STM.
- Agents.
- Atoms.
- Reducers.
- Goroutines interop.
- Composite literals interop.
